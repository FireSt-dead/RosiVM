    <h1>RosiStudio</h1>
    <p>
      I am developing a "RosiStudio" to verify some of the language experiments I am doing.
      It can not be called IDE since its current purpose is to support the language development,
      rather than actual application development.
      At the moment it is terrible, parses on keysstroke and on a page of code may spend 3 sec. to update
      (most of which spend on higlighting rather than actual compilation).
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it will soon be able to generate HTML code snippets with highlighting for this site... :)
      Also when a true compiler rolls on it will be of great help to push forward the language implementation.
