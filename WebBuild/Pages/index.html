    <h1>RosiVM - High Level Object Oriented Language and Virtual Machine.</h1>
    <p>
      I have a background of .NET C#, Flash AS3, HTML and JavaScript and some C, C++ and Java;
      So far the .NET and C# get closest to what I consider a perfect framework.
      Yet I had most fun while I was working with Flash.
      Flash is slowly dying however as adobe is focusing on HTML.
      Now in my spare time I am doing some work, trying to get what made me happy in Flash,
      and fill the gaps with what is available in .NET. And since I do not have much of that spare time,
      I will be taking any possible shortcuts,
      the documentations would be short and punctual,
      often things would be let to your imagination.

    <h2>Version 0.01</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently working on the language and language spec, along with compiler front-end.
      The parser is written in the <a href="http://goldparser.org/" target="_blank">GOLD</a>.
      There is a .NET tool currently that with simple tree rewriting algorithms
      converts GOLD's parse tree to AST in XML format. (yep XML, because its cool)
      XML allows us to convert code to colorized HTML,
      to navigate easily the tree with xpath,
      to build API reference,
      and is overall is flexible.
      Once the language is set in stone we will measure performance and if necessary implement non XML version.
    </p>
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>
      Currently the code is not even in an alpha state...<br/>
      You can find the RosiVM playground in github:<br/>

    <h2>License</h2>
    <p>
      I think to release the language under the MIT license.
      I do not have plans for VM and tools just yet.
