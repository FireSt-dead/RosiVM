    <h1>RosiLang, The Language</h1>
    <p>Currently the language is under development so we will elaborate on examples later. For now this is a small preview:</p>
    <code lang="rvm">
      module geom {
        public class Point {
          var x: number;
          var y: number;

          public method add(p: Point) => Point {
            this.x += p.x;
            this.y += p.y;
          }
        }
      }
    </code>
    <p>
      The language is inspired pretty much by the C# type system and AS3 and TypeScript syntax.
      We are currently adding some noise (such as the "method") keyword to avoid easily grammar ambiguity,
      but it probably would be removed in the final version.

    <h2>Language Definition</h2>
    <p>
      The grammer is written in the <a href="http://goldparser.org/" target="_blank">GOLD</a> language.
      <a href="http://goldparser.org/" target="_blank">GOLD</a> uses a BNF as a language and can build a LALR parser, which is cool... and free... and integrates well with .NET...
